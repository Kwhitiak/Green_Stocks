# Analysis of Green Stocks for 2017 and 2018
## Analysing the difference in value and return between the years 2017 and 2018


### Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

The perfomrance on the stock between 2017 and 2018 ended up being lower in 2018.  Only two stock in 2018 showed a positive return while the rest showed negative returns.  


### The refactored script also allowed the code to run the results much faster per the below images.

### Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.



### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

The advatages of refactoring code allows the code to run more efficiently by requiring less memory.  This allows the script to complete its task at a much faster rater.

Although Refactoring code makes the code run fatser and more efficiently, it may also complicate the code and cause errors.  The errors may take extensive knowledge to debug and would require multiple check for accuracy.  

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

Citing this challenge as an example of the pros and cons of refactoring code, our code did in fact run faster and more efficiently but it took much longer to complete and debug.  After seeking assitance with my error, it was foudn that the origional "starter code"  neeeded adjustements to work with the refactoring.
